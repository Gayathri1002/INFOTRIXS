Deploying Application in Monolithic Architecture

**Step 1: Launch EC2 Instance**

1. Launch an EC2 instance for WordPress and MySQL(Ubuntu):

   - Choose an Ubuntu Server AMI.
   - Configure the instance type (t2.micro) and network settings as needed.
   - Create or choose an existing security group that allows HTTP and HTTPS traffic (port 80 and 443) for the instance.
   

**Step 2: Configure EC2 Instance**

1. Open MobaXterm.
2. Create an SSH session with your EC2 instance by entering the public IP address, username (e.g., ubuntu), and specifying your private key file.
3. Connect to the session, and you can start configuring your EC2 Ubuntu instance via the terminal window in MobaXterm.


**Step 3: Configure WordPress and MySQL on the EC2 Instance**

1. Install Apache server on Ubuntu

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt install apache2
   ```
   
2. Install php runtime and php mysql connector

   ```bash
   sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
   ```

3. Install MySQL server

   ```bash
   sudo apt install mysql-server
   ```

4. Login to MySQL server

   ```bash
   sudo mysql -u root
   ```

5. Change authentication plugin to mysql_native_password
   Create a new database user for wordpress (change the password)
   Create a database for wordpress
   Grant all privilges on the database 'wordpress' to the newly created user
   
   ```bash
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password by 'Password';
   CREATE USER 'wordpress-user'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'Password';
   CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wp.* TO 'wordpress-user'@localhost;
   EXIT;
   ```

6. Download and configure WordPress:

   ```bash
   cd /var/www/html
   sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.zip
   sudo apt install unzip
   unzip tatest.zip
   sudo mv wordpress/ /var/www/html
   ```

7. Edit the WordPress configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php
   ```


**Step 4: Start the Services**

  Start Apache on the WordPress EC2 instance:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   sudo systemctl enable apache2
   ```

**Step 5: Access WordPress**

You can access your WordPress site by opening your web browser and navigating to the public IP address or domain name of your ubuntu EC2 instance.
